2. Cartpole environment: https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/classic_control/cart_pole/
3. Agent Recording: https://gymnasium.farama.org/introduction/record_agent/

Run: `python3 DQN_cartpole.py` or execute the notebook `DQN_cartpole.ipynb`.

Coming up: Policy Gradient algorithms such as REINFORCE, PPO, and DDPG.

Will update the requirements.
